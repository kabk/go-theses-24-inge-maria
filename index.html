          In the same way that chalk is a porous material, having minute cracks
          and holes through which air, gas, or liquid can pass, I want to take a
          porous approach to my writing and structure of this essay.

          In Danish, the word
          kalk, directly translating to chalk, encompasses both chalkstone and
          limestone.

          Therefore, when I write chalk, I am talking about kalk, meaning it
          could be either of the two. My first statement could in that sense
          suggest, that I do not intend on serving airtight opinions or facts,
          impenetrable by no argument, but that I instead wish to allow myself
          to build up the text with sediments of language and comparisons, in a
          way that could make sense but also easily could be picked apart.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          After all, it is the easy picking apart of chalk, due to its porous
          and friable properties, that leads to discovery of geological
          knowledge and stories of past life. Calcium carbonate, a mineral with
          a low particle density and the main component of chalk, is the reason
          behind those characteristics.<sup

          Hard and stable enough to exist and continuously form through millions
          of years, and soft enough to preserve traces and easily break,
          chalkstone is a perfect time capsule. It is those specific properties
          of kalk that allow the preservation of stories, told in the form of
          layers of sediment, traces and fossils.

        <p class="para">
          If, for that reason, I gave chalkstone the role of a storyteller, its
          voice would be a million microscopic skeletons. Coccoliths, as they
          are called, who upon death collapse into their constituent parts, have
          been drizzling down on the sea floor through millions of years. The
          calcium derived from these plankton shells, transforms into sediments
          of lime mud which, through pressure and heat, turns into stone.<sup

          Most of such formations took place in the Cretaceous period, 145 to 66
          million years ago, facilitated by the warm waters of the epeiric seas
          – large inland seas which, at the time, existed in many parts of the
          world. Calcium carbonate is less soluble in warmer water, just as the
          plankton, from which the calcium is derived, reproduce more actively

          You could think of each fossil as an entire story in itself. One of
          soft-bodied parts, colours and texture. But chalk can only talk in
          grey tones and of skeletal form, thereby taking all individual stories
          and bringing them together in one tale, making them part of the same
          matter.

          As a little lump in your teacher's hand, the word chalk is commonly
          associated with a different kind of storytelling. Bright white letters
          on a dark background, constantly added and wiped away, swiftly moving
          from information to information. The value of chalk and limestone is
          reduced to its societal employment, as a transmitter of essential
          information from teacher to student on a blackboard, as well as an
          important part of manufactured construction materials. As the little
          white piece in your teacher's hand slowly vanishes, giving its life to
          conjugation of French verbs, one after the other, it is easy to forget
          the knowledge and stories that chalk contains on its own.

          Noticeably, skeletal remains – bones, are more likely than any soft
          organic material to defy decomposition and to fossilize. Bone can
          escape decay thanks to calcium, which clings onto the main component
          of the bone structure, collagen, like a protective raincoat,

          should it land in the right place. It is the same mineral, calcium,
          derived from micro skeletons, that forms into chalk. Should the bone

          The Cloud, an enormous inaccessible archive of personal information,
          takes active part in the constraint and regulation of human
          experience. Therefore, to understand contemporary society, one cannot
          simply look at the horizontal geographies without also considering the
          vertical layers of sedimented information-strata.

          But, understanding the past has perhaps always been a vertical act? At
          least in the literal sense of ‘digging down’ from the strata of the
          sky into the strata of the subsoil to excavate resources and to find
          traces of evolution. If I, for the purpose of discussing specifically
          what will remain, name the Cloud the Rock instead of the stack, the
          attention should shift from the geopolitical specifics of our society
          to the leftovers of it. Imagining future generations making
          archaeological excavations down into the thick strata of all the data
          we leave behind adds a new importance to our understanding of it, like
          a window into the stories of our time. Following this thought, the
          Cloud will take a similar role of a storyteller as the one I gave
          chalkstone. Instead of bones in chalk sediments, will it then be the
          ‘skeletons’ of our digital lives that will be ‘dug up’ as valuable
          fossils? To answer that question, and to be able to compare our
          digital footprint to our skeletons, we would have to be assured that
          data is as likely to defy decomposition as bone. Furthermore, we would
          have to limit the idea of who we leave something behind for to future
          generations of humans. Who is to say whether species beyond the
          Anthropocene would know how to extract meaningful data from these

          He argues that our infrastructures perform the same form of motion
          control as our skeletons do in relation to our fleshy parts, our soft
          parts. And as such, this 480 million years old form of exoskeletal
          architecture taps into the Deleuzian quip that God is a lobster
          performing a double articulation, as the two sides of the lobster claw
          pinches us into a space of territorialized stratification. Here, both
          sedimentation and mineralization, which are processes of
          solidification – formation of hard parts, result in a certain
          redundancy and restriction. A restriction of movement of bodies, but
          also of thought, in the way it tempts one to think of history as a
          linear, stackable progression, layer upon layer. The bryozoans,
          however, perform a different, rather rhizomatic form of solidification
          and exoskeletal formation. Starting as just one, from which the colony
          expands, the modular structure of the bryozoan can take an endless
          number of shapes, depending on the environment, fossilizing into an
          array of different forms, making them hard to recognize, classify and
          predict. Bryozoans hint at how Earth, although consisting of layers of

          flows, formed through the interaction of geological forces, climatic
          conditions, and biological processes.<sup

          Exhibiting properties that transcend the sum of their parts, these
          assemblages give rise to new patterns and structures. As such, the
          many non-linear connections that the story of deep-time and the chalk
          cliff consist of are more important in their narrative than the
          individual strata or the individual fossils found in the sediments.

          As I remember the porosity of the chalkstone material, the traces on
          the cliff face begin to resemble pores, running through it, turning
          the entire coastal profile into a porous painting. It appears not only
          to be the material in itself, but the entire narrative chalk contains
          that is porous.

          EARTH AS A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS – TIME AS A SKELETAL CYCLE

          If chalkstone tells its stories through the voice of
          minuscule plankton skeletons, an array of different bony substances is
          simultaneously seeping in through the cracks of the porous narrative.
          From plankton skeletons of chalk-formation to the skeletons in bodies,
          and from the hollowed-out skeleton of Earth in Gaiaporosis, to the
          exoskeletons of our digital information, the story of chalk appears to
          take form as a skeletal cycle, encouraging us to remember that our own
          bones, our skeletons, are the part of us that most easily crosses the
          threshold into the world of rocks.<sup

          It is a cycle in which hard parts are preserved, transformed and
          transported on journeys through millions of years, on the way
          encountering and participating in multiple soft-part-epochs that
          appear out of dynamic networks of events and matter, to then decay
          again. We, encompassing organic material, invisible digital
          information, hierarchies, and societal structures, are one of those
          soft epochs, all hosted in the hard skeletons, constructed of mineral
          leftovers from previous ones. Although our systems, norms and power
          structures seem solidified as a current geology of morals, they are
          not solidified in deep time. They remain soft.

          The traces between layers in the cliff, the chalk dust that stains the
          blackboard, and the particles that cover Earth after catastrophes all
          hint at the interconnected nature of what we are, what is left behind
          and what will come. It is this cycle of dynamic, non-linear flows and
          connections that can be found as the story of chalkstone.
